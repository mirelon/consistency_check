# ConsistencyCheck

Run your own consistency checks and store results (time, name of the check, consisitency violations) in DB.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'consistency_check'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install consistency_check
    
Then run generators, which create a migration, model and dummy consistency check definitions:

    $ rails g consistency_check:install
    
And migrations:

    $ rails db:migrate

## Usage

Write your own consistency check definitions into the file `jobs/consistency_check/definitions.rb` and run

    $ ConsistencyCheck.run_all
