# ConsistencyCheck

Run your own consistency checks and store results (time, name of the check, consisitency violations) in DB.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'consistency_check'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install consistency_check
    
Then run generators, which create a migration, model and dummy consistency check definitions:

    $ rails g consistency_check:install
    
And migrations:

    $ rails db:migrate

## Usage

Write your own consistency check definitions into the file `jobs/consistency_check/definitions.rb` and run

    $ ConsistencyCheck.run_all

Usage with ActiveAdmin:

```
ActiveAdmin.register ConsistencyCheckResult do
  actions :index

  action_item :run do
    link_to 'Run all consistency checks', run_admin_consistency_check_results_path
  end

  collection_action :run do
    ConsistencyCheck.run_all.map(&:save)
    redirect_to admin_consistency_check_results_path
  end
end
```
